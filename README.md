# Quine Mccluskey
An Implementation of the "Quine Mccluskey Algorithm" for simplifying Boolean expressions.

| A | B | F |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

A) Enter the number of inputs:  e.g. the above Truth table has two inputs A and B.                                                        
B) Enter the minterms: e.g. the above table has three minterms                                                                             
                               a) 01 = 1                                                                                                      
                               b) 10 = 2                                                                                                            
                               c) 11 = 3
